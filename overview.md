# Decision Engine

Decision Engine enables policy authors to automate policy decisions by leveraging machine learning (ML) and business rules to produce a decision. The decision engine provides capabilities such as managing the policy rules, policy rule life cycle management, and preserves decisions for audit and analytics. The platform has out-of-the-box integration with internal and external services, feature stores, and model execution environments. 

Decision engine outcome would be to:

* Recommend a product behavior
* Create a manual review for operations
* React using product controls in extreme cases

## Capabilities

The Decision Engine platform provides common APIs to enable services to integrate with rule based engine (e.g. Drools) to make risk assessment decisions. The platform provides capabilities such as rule artifact management, storing decisions for data analysis, managing events emitted by the rule engine, etc.

* Out of the box integration with Drools workbench. A popular workbench for writing business rules.
* Rule artifact manager to manage the deployment of rule artifacts for all rule based services
* Managed CI/CD Pipelines to automate and text new rule changes
* Manage events emitted by rule engines for creating decisions (create case, close account, etc.)
* Eager and lazy rule data fetching
* Integration and Invocation of ML models in real-time hosted on Sagemaker and MXS
* Integration & feedback from external vendors (GreenDot, Kount, Ethoca, BioCatch, Giact, Whitepages, Experian, ThreatMetrix, Quickbase, etc.)
* Integration with Data Analytics (RDM)
* Reusable commands to be used across multiple services
* Support of silent mode and/or champion/challenger testing of new models/rules
* Support sync/async risk assessment modes
* Hot deployment of rules without restarting applications
* Common automation test framework 
* SOX compliance controls & preserving test evidence out of the box
* Agent tool(s) integration (IBOSS, ASC, Sentinel, Kount, etc).

## Benefits
Decision engine automates the work of executing business rules to produce a decision. Business rules execution for risk and fraud detection when done manually is expensive and susceptible to human errors. Having the ability to automate rule based workflows enables the business to quickly implement fraud and risk controls as the decision is made quickly. The Pegasus Decision Engine implements a hybrid approach of combining machine learning models and workflow specific rules. This allows for a more flexible system, which is less expensive, and produces smarter decisions.

Decision engines can be used in many work streams today:

* Account onboarding
* Post underwriting
* Transaction authorization
* Transaction clearing
* Deposit funding
* Email verification
* Identity management
* And any other user case where decision making is required

## Architecture

Architectural Diagram Description:
As shown in the above Architectural Diagram, the Decision Engine SDK provides many capabilities to the Domain API applications with the help of Decision Engine Services. The Drools Workbench is comprised of UI, wherein the rule writers author/edit the Business rules. Once the rules are written, the Artefact Manager deploys the rules from one environment to another(ex: Pre-prod to Prod).
The Event Management processes the outcomes of the Decision Engine in the form of Recommendation, React, and Review.
Kafka, ActiveMQ, and SQS are the existing asynchronous messaging Qâ€™s through which risk decisions and even notifications get posted in Rules SDK. Once the Decision Engine SDK is onboarded onto the domain application, rules work on Data Objects in which date for some fields are fetched from request, and data for other fields are fetched from the vendor. REST API is used to transfer the data between vendors and SDK. There are two types that data gets fetched from the vendor. They are Eager fetching and Lazy fetching. Eager fetching is the process of getting the data before processing the request. In Lazy fetching, the data is fetched only when required.
Once everything is onboarded and ready, the Domain API application has now the capability of Decision Engine.
